#INPUT: DNA.fas
#OUTPUT: ID of String with highest GC Content & GC content of string

# the file does not display like a text so we need to put it into a format of a readable text. 

filepath = "./rosalind_gc.txt"
with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
            

# Now we need to cut the ">" and make it a string so we can isolate the name and the DNA sequence


# From the string we would need to calculate the percentage of GC groups in the string 


# Then define a function to identify the string with most GC % and print the name as well ass the percentage



# honestly I have no idea how to even tackle this so above are my logically constructed ideas how to solve this problem. I am looking forward to the group effort in class tomorrow
